        <p>The center advises anyone who might come  cross paths with rattlesnakes to be aware of these five things:</p>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Baby rattle snakes range in length from 6 to 12 and are easily camouflaged by brush and grass.</li>
                <li>Baby rattle snakes are rattleness until they first shed their skins,so there will be no infamous "chica-chica" sound before they strike.</li>
                <li>Despite their impish size,baby snakes have enough venom to be very dangerous if they bite a human</li>
                <li>Adult rattlesnakes  donot always rattle an audible warning before or while they are biting </li>
                <li>It's good idea to call the poison center if you notice an unidentified small cut or wound,even if you feel no pain.With lack of telltale rattle warning,people can be bitten without knowing what has happened untilthey notice their symptoms and attribute them to snakebite.</li>
            </ol>
